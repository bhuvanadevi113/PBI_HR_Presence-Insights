# PBI_HR_Presence-Insights
For this project, I want to make a dashboard that displays the percentage of employees who work from home, are absent, and take sick days. Developed a dashboard after obtaining the dataset in Excel format from HR.

Work-from-home percentage shows an increasing trend over time, peaking at 23.4% in May 2022.
### Attendance % by Day of Week:

Gradual decline towards the end of the week, with the lowest on Friday (90.1%).
